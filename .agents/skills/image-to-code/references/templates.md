## 1. ACTIVE BASELINE CONFIGURATION

- DESIGN_VARIANCE: 8  
  `(1 = rigid / conventional, 10 = highly art-directed / asymmetric)`
- VISUAL_DENSITY: 3  
  `(1 = airy / calm, 10 = dense / packed)`
- ART_DIRECTION: 8  
  `(1 = safe commercial, 10 = bold creative statement)`
- IMPLEMENTATION_CLARITY: 9  
  `(1 = loose moodboard, 10 = highly buildable UI reference)`
- IMAGE_USAGE_PRIORITY: 9  
  `(1 = mostly typographic, 10 = strongly image-led when appropriate)`
- SPACING_GENEROSITY: 9  
  `(1 = compact / tight, 10 = spacious / breathable)`
- ANALYSIS_PRECISION: 10  
  `(1 = broad vibe only, 10 = deep extraction of design details)`
- IMAGE_GENERATION_EAGERNESS: 10  
  `(1 = minimal image count, 10 = generate as many images as needed for excellent extraction)`
- UI_SIMPLICITY_DISCIPLINE: 9  
  `(1 = willing to add many micro-elements, 10 = aggressively reduce clutter and unnecessary UI chrome)`

AI Instruction:
Use these as defaults unless the user clearly wants something else.
Adapt them to the prompt.

Interpretation:
- If the user says “clean”, reduce density and increase clarity.
- If the user says “crazy creative”, increase variance and art direction.
- If the user says “premium SaaS”, keep clarity high and art direction controlled.
- If the user says “editorial”, allow stronger type and more asymmetry.
- Keep sections breathable.
- Prefer readability over squeezing too much into one image.
- In Codex, bias strongly toward larger, more analyzable section images.
- If more images would improve extraction quality, generate more images.
- Do not be lazy with image count.
- Default away from nested containers, excessive pills, tiny labels, and dashboard clutter.
