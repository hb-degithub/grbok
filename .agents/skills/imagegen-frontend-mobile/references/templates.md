## 1. ACTIVE BASELINE CONFIGURATION

- DESIGN_VARIANCE: 8  
  `(1 = rigid / standard, 10 = highly art-directed / varied)`
- VISUAL_DENSITY: 3  
  `(1 = airy / calm, 10 = dense / packed)`

  `(1 = safe utility UI, 10 = bold premium mobile statement)`
- PLATFORM_AWARENESS: 9  
  `(1 = generic phone UI, 10 = strongly app-native)`
- FLOW_VARIETY: 8  
  `(1 = repeated screen templates, 10 = clearly differentiated screen rhythm)`
- IMAGE_GENERATION_EAGERNESS: 10  
  `(1 = minimal screens, 10 = generate as many screens and detail views as needed)`
- SPACING_GENEROSITY: 9  
  `(1 = tight, 10 = spacious and breathable)`
- CLARITY_DISCIPLINE: 10  
  `(1 = loose vibe, 10 = highly readable, structured, and clean)`
- IMAGE_CREATIVITY: 9  
  `(1 = minimal image involvement, 10 = strongly art-directed imagery and creative visual treatments)`
- TEXTURE_STRENGTH: 7  
  `(1 = perfectly flat, 10 = rich tactile/noisy/textured surfaces)`
- COLOR_PALETTE_DISCIPLINE: 10  
  `(1 = random or muddy color use, 10 = always clean, controlled, premium palette logic)`
- NON_GENERICITY: 10  
  `(1 = acceptable to look standard, 10 = must feel distinct and specific)`
- COMPLEXITY_WITH_CONTROL: 8  
  `(1 = forced minimalism only, 10 = allowed to be richer and more layered as long as it stays clean)`
- CONSISTENCY_STRENGTH: 10  
  `(1 = loose screen relationship, 10 = one clear product system across all images)`
- FLOW_LOGIC_DISCIPLINE: 10  
  `(1 = random screen set, 10 = clearly logical app progression)`
- MOCKUP_FRAME_DISCIPLINE: 9  
  `(1 = sloppy device presentation, 10 = clean, even, premium device framing)`
- TEXT_READABILITY_PRIORITY: 10  
  `(1 = text may become decorative/small, 10 = text must stay clearly readable)`
- CONTENT_FIRST_MOCKUP_BALANCE: 10  
  `(1 = device frame dominates, 10 = device frame supports the screen but content remains the hero)`
- MIN_TEXT_SIZE_DISCIPLINE: 10  
  `(1 = small text acceptable, 10 = text must never feel too small at normal viewing size)`

AI Instruction:
Use these as defaults unless the user clearly wants something else.
Adapt them to the app category.

Interpretation:
- If the user says "clean", reduce density and increase clarity.
- If the user says "premium iOS", bias toward elegant restraint and native-feeling hierarchy.
- If the user says "Android", bias toward stronger Material-like structure and navigation clarity.
- If the user says "creative social app", increase visual variance and image creativity without sacrificing readability.
- If the user says "fintech", "health", or "productivity", increase trust, calmness, and structural clarity.
- Do not be lazy with screen count.
- If more screens would make the flow better, generate more screens.
- If more detail renders would make the UI clearer, generate more detail renders.
- Default toward richer art direction than standard AI mobile output.
- Use creative assets, texture, and imagery deliberately, not randomly.
- Always keep the color palette clean, controlled, and intentional.
- Avoid generic color choices.
- Do not force every app into ultra-simple minimalism.
- Keep text comfortably readable at normal viewing size.
- Maintain strong consistency across all generated images in the same set.
- Keep device framing neat, even, and professional.
- Show the app inside a clean phone mockup by default, but keep the focus on the app content.
